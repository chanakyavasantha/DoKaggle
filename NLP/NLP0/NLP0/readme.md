# NLP0: Natural Language Processing Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the NLP0 folder, your starting point for learning the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This beginner's guide aims to provide you with essential resources, sample code, and explanations to help you get started with NLP.

## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human languages. NLP techniques enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, making it a crucial component of applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.

## Getting Started

If you're new to NLP, here's a suggested roadmap to kickstart your journey:

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have a basic understanding of Python programming and fundamental concepts of machine learning.

2. **Topics Covered**: This guide will introduce you to various NLP concepts and techniques, including but not limited to:
   - Text Preprocessing
   - Tokenization
   - Stop Words Removal
   - Stemming and Lemmatization
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
   - Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
   - Sentiment Analysis
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
   - Text Classification
   - Language Models (e.g., GPT-3, BERT)

3. **Resources**: You'll find example code, Jupyter notebooks, and links to external resources within this folder to help you understand and implement NLP techniques.

4. **Exercises**: Practice is essential in mastering NLP. Try working on the provided exercises and projects to solidify your knowledge.
